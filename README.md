# Word Masters App

### What is Word Masters App?
Word masters App is a game app that allows users to play bulls and cows together and see each other's bulls and cows. This app is for people who enjoy word games and competition. If you and your friend think Wordle is too easy then this is the game for you. 

The idea behind Bulls and Cows is a play on the game Mastermind. The game goes like this, a word will be selected for this case it is going to be "turn". One person will guess "fire" and they would recieve 1 bull and 0 cows. Bull meaning that one of the letters in fire is in the correct spot for the word you are guessing at. Then the next person would go, only knowing that their partner got 1 bull and 0 cows and guesses nest. This would give them 0 bulls and 2 cows, meaning they got 2 letters that are in the final word but they were not in the correct spot. The two players will then continue to go back and forth until someone recieves 4 bulls and wins the game.

This app is useful because it allows for people to play this game while they are not together and also not let people cheat because they are unable to see what each of them guess. It is also fun for people who like a challenge because we have added three difficulties where the harder you go, the longer the words are. Easy is 4, Medium is 5 and Hard is 6 or 7.
